        "description": "Summary React in Action introduces front-end developers to the React framework and related tools. This clearly written, example-rich book begins by introducing you to React, diving into some of the fundamental ideas in React, and working with components. In the second section, you'll explore the different ways that data works in React as well as learning more about components. You'll also find several useful appendixes covering related topics like React tooling and the React ecosystem. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Technology Facebook created React to help deliver amazing user experiences on a website with thousands of components and an incomprehensible amount of traffic. The same powerful tools are available to you too! The key is a clever design for managing state, data flow, and rendering, so your application is easy to think about and runs smoothly. Add an incredibly rich ecosystem of components and libraries, and you've got a recipe for building web apps that will delight both developers and users. About the Book React in Action teaches you to think like a pro about user interfaces and building them with React. This practical book gets you up and running quickly with hands-on examples in every chapter. You'll master core topics like rendering, lifecycle methods, JSX, data flow, forms, routing, integrating with third-party libraries, and testing. And the included application design ideas will help make your apps pop. As you learn to integrate React into full-stack applications, you'll explore state management with Redux and server-side rendering, and even dabble in React Native for mobile UIs. What's Inside React from the ground up Implementing a routing system with components Server-side rendering in Node.js Working with third-party libraries Testing React components About the Reader Written for developers familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. About the Author Mark Thomas is an experienced software engineer who works daily with React, JavaScript, and Node.js. He loves clean code, beautiful systems, and good coffee.

With this hands-on guide, youâ€™ll learn how to build applications that target iOS, Android, and other mobile platforms instead of browsers. Youâ€™ll also discover how to access platform features such as the camera, user location, and local storage. With code examples and step-by-step instructions, author Bonnie Eisenman shows web developers and frontend engineers how to build and style interfaces, use mobile components, and debug and deploy apps. Along the way, youâ€™ll build several increasingly sophisticated sample apps with React Native before putting everything together at the end. Learn how React Native provides an interface to native UI components Examine how the framework uses native components analogous to HTML elements Create and style your own React Native components and applications Install modules for APIs and features not supported by the framework Get tools for debugging your code, and for handling issues outside of JavaScript Put it all together with the Zebreto effective-memorization flashcard app Deploy apps to the iOS App Store and Googleâ€™s Play Store",

Node.js is a scalable application server that is used in thousands of websites, while GraphQL is becoming the standard way for large websites to provide data and services to their users. Together, these technologies, when reinforced with the capabilities of TypeScript, provide a cutting-edge stack for complete web application development. This book takes a hands-on approach to implementing modern web technologies and the associated methodologies for building full-stack apps. Youâ€™ll begin by gaining a strong understanding of TypeScript and how to use it to build high-quality web apps. The chapters that follow delve into client-side development with React using the new Hooks API and Redux. Next, youâ€™ll get to grips with server-side development with Express, including authentication with Redis-based sessions and accessing databases with TypeORM. The book will then show you how to use Apollo GraphQL to build web services for your full-stack app. Later, youâ€™ll learn how to build GraphQL schemas and integrate them with React using Hooks. Finally, youâ€™ll focus on how to deploy your application onto an NGINX server using the AWS cloud. By the end of this book, youâ€™ll be able to build and deploy complete high-performance web applications using React, Node, and GraphQL. What you will learnDiscover TypeScriptâ€™s most important features and how they can be used to improve code quality and maintainabilityUnderstand what React Hooks are and how to build React apps using themImplement state management for your React app using ReduxSet up an Express project with TypeScript and GraphQL from scratchBuild a fully functional online forum app using React and GraphQLAdd authentication to your web app using RedisSave and retrieve data from a Postgres database using TypeORMConfigure NGINX on the AWS cloud to deploy and serve your appsWho this book is for The book is for web developers who want to go beyond front-end web development and enter the world of full-stack web development by learning about modern web technologies and how they come together. A good understanding of JavaScript programming is required before getting started with this web development book.",

No knowledge of React is needed, though a working knowledge of ES2015 will help you follow along better. What You Will Learn Craft reusable React components Control navigation using the React Router to help keep your UI in sync with URLs Build isomorphic web applications using Node.js Use the Flexbox layout model to create responsive mobile designs Leverage the native APIs of Android and iOS to build engaging applications with React Native Respond to gestures in a way that's intuitive for the user Use Relay to build a unified data architecture for your React UIs In Detail React and React Native allow you to build cross-platform desktop and mobile applications using Facebook's innovative UI libraries. Combined with the Flux data architecture and Relay, you can now create powerful and feature-complete applications from just one code base! This book is split into three parts. The first part shows you how to start crafting composable UIs using React, from rendering with JSX and creating reusable components through to routing and creating isomorphic applications that run on Node. We then move on to showing you how to take the concepts of React and apply them to building Native UIs using React Native. You'll find out how to build responsive and streamlined UIs that can properly handle user interactions in a mobile environment. You'll also learn how to access device-specific APIs such as the geolocation API, and how to handle offline development with React Native. Finally, we'll tie all of these skills together and shows you how you can create React applications that run on every major platform. As well as understanding application state in depth, you'll learn how to leverage Relay to make feature-complete, data-driven web and native mobile applications. Style and approach Split into three major sections to help organize your learning, this hands-on, code-first book will help you get up to speed with React and React Nativeâ€”the UI framework that powers Netflix, Yahoo, and Facebook.",
